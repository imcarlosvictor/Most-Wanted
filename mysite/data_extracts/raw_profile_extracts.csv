Diaz-Juarez is one of these pimps. During the investigation, it was revealed that some women and girls were compelled into performing commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, or a combination thereof, including the use of locked rooms to maintain control over the young women and girls. Diaz-Juarez used force and/or violence to punish and control young females he prostituted in the Houston area.</p>

They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 ½ inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims’ personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word ""this"" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub.

Anderson was convicted and sentenced to over 300 years in prison for the 1999 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Xiana Fairchild in Vallejo, California, and other crimes. He was captured after one of his kidnap victims was able to escape. Anderson was interviewed by FBI agents in November of 2007, and confessed to murdering eight victims in the United States, including Fairchild and 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole, California. Anderson also confessed to two murders in Mexico, but did not provide any information on those victims.
The following is a list of the stateside victims’ descriptions given by Anderson in chronological order:

Anderson allegedly met and killed her and then disposed of her body near a local swimming hole in Marysville, California. Victim #2 was a young female hitchhiker in her late teens, whom Anderson claimed he picked up on a road near the northeast side of Clearlake a few days after the death of Victim #1.
Early 1985: Victim #3 was a female in her late teens, also residing in the Marysville area, who was possibly a runaway from Oregon.
November 1986: Victim #4 was about 21 years old. She was a light-skinned Black female whom Anderson met in a bar frequented by African-Americans located in the East Bay, off Interstate-80 on San Pablo Avenue. He claimed this occurred about 10 days after he was paroled from San Quentin State Prison. Anderson allegedly killed her and disposed of the body in the Oakland hills.
June 1988: Victim #5 was Amber Swartz-Garcia, who Anderson said was standing on a street in Pinole, California, when he physically forced her into his car. He eventually murdered her in Arizona.
1988/1989: Victim #6 was allegedly a Navajo Indian woman about 23 to 24 years old. Anderson claimed he picked her up coming out of a bar near 5th or 6th Street in Benicia, California. He said he then killed her near Benson, Arizona.

He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.  At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction.
